# `plot_degree_histogram.py` Documentation

## Purpose

This script plots the distribution of a selected grain degree feature (e.g., `neighbor_count`, `delaunay_degree_fixed_50`, `delaunay_degree_adaptive_1r1std`) for a single sample. It helps visualize the frequency of grains with different numbers of neighbors according to a specific definition of neighborhood.

## Prerequisites

*   A `_details.csv` file containing per-grain features for the sample, including the degree column specified for plotting. This file is generated by `run_feature_extraction.py` using the `--save_grain_details` flag.

## Usage

```bash
python plot_degree_histogram.py --details_csv <path_to_details_file> \
                                --output_path <path_to_save_image.png> \
                                [--degree_column <degree_feature_name>] \
                                [--bin_width <width>] \
                                [--plot_type <type>]
```

## Arguments

*   `--details_csv` (required): Path to the input `_details.csv` file containing per-grain features.
*   `--output_path` (required): Path where the output plot image (e.g., `.png`) will be saved.
*   `--degree_column` (optional): The name of the column in the `_details.csv` file containing the degree data to plot. Default: `'neighbor_count'`. You can specify other calculated degrees like `'delaunay_degree_fixed_50'` or `'delaunay_degree_adaptive_1r1std'`.
*   `--bin_width` (optional): The width of bins to use when `plot_type` is `'hist'`. Default: `1`.
*   `--plot_type` (optional): The type of plot to generate. Options are:
    *   `'hist'` (default): Generates a histogram showing the count of grains within degree bins.
    *   `'bar'`: Generates a bar chart showing the exact count for each discrete degree value.

## Output

*   An image file (e.g., `.png`) saved at the specified `--output_path`. The plot shows the distribution of the selected grain degree feature for the sample.

## Interpretation & Materials Science Significance

*   **Distribution Shape**: Observe the overall shape of the distribution. Is it unimodal (single peak), bimodal, or multimodal? Is it symmetric, skewed left, or skewed right? This reflects the typical connectivity environment of grains.
*   **Peak Location**: Identify the most frequent degree value(s). This indicates the most common local arrangement of grains.
*   **Spread/Width**: Assess the range or standard deviation of the degrees. A narrow distribution suggests a more uniform connectivity pattern, while a wide distribution indicates greater heterogeneity in local environments.
*   **Comparison (Manual)**: Generate histograms for different degree definitions (e.g., physical vs. Delaunay adaptive) for the same sample to see how the neighborhood definition affects the perceived connectivity distribution. Generate histograms for the same degree definition across different samples to visually compare their distributions (though `compare_degree_distributions.py` is better suited for formal comparison).

This plot provides a fundamental characterization of the sample's topological structure based on local grain connectivity.
